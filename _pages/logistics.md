#### Collaboration Policy

We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of
this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students
in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit
individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any
collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the
instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected

#### Late Policy

Homework assignments and course project results are worth full credit on the due date. Unless granted an 
extension in advance, it is worth at most 75% credit for the next 48 hours, at most 50% credit after that. If 
you need an extension, please ask for it as soon as the need for it is known. Extensions that are requested 
promptly can be granted more liberally. You must turn in all assignments.

#### Use of LLM/VLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
We encourage you to use ChatGPT to solve the homework assignment problems (because likely in
the future everyone will use it for coding). However, you will need to declare using ChatGPT/LLMs in
the homework README, as well as the prompts you use
You are **not allowed** to use LLM for in-class test!!!

#### Regrade Policy

If you feel that we have made a mistake in grading your homework, please submit a regrading request on Gradescope and we will consider your request.
Please note that regrading of a homework may cause your grade to go either up or down.
